   <h2>Problem / Data Domain</h2>
   <p>
     Many people have encountered issues managing their groceries, resulting in food waste and preparing meals.
     According to the USDA, more than 30% of food in American households is wasted each year, mostly because
     people forget what they have in the fridge or purchase unnecessary things. This issue is especially
     targeting amongst busy students and working adults who don’t have the time to track ingredients and plan nutritious meals.
     The issue is not only an individual problem; it also has an environmental impact, since wasted food contributes to greenhouse gas
     emissions from landfills.
   </p>
   <p>
     There are several applications, such as Mealime and Yummly, include meal planning tools or Fridgely that tracks expiration dates.
     However, most apps require users to add goods manually, which is tedious and discourages frequent use.
     A more efficient method would be to combine these features into a single web app that
     automatically counts groceries (via receipts or barcode scans), recommends meals based on available ingredients,
     and sends reminders before food expires. This would allow consumers to save money, minimize waste, and establish
     more sustainable household routines.

   <h2>Proposed Application</h2>
   <p>
     In order to address our given problem, we intend to build a web application targeted towards young adults— particularly those who
     struggle with time, organization, and/or planning— to help keep constant track of their meal options for any given point in time.
     To accomplish this, we want prioritize building the following features:
     <ol>
      <li>
        <b>The ability to create and manage a personal, and preferably
        visualized fridge (through the use of clip-art or something similar) tied to the user’s account.</b> Receipts or barcodes can be scanned
        to immediately store food storage information, which include (but are not exclusive to) details such as type of food, date acquired,
        and expected duration of freshness.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>A saved list of possible meals to make, which can either be added manually or extracted from other meal ideas that may be posted
        publicly on the web app’s domain.</b> Though a description of the meal (image, recipe, etc.) can be provided, we intend to keep the
        feature optional (unless made public) as its purpose is mainly to remind users of what options are available to them to reduce planning
        stress. These meals can be organized and filtered by ingredient, alphabetically, most recent, favorites, etc. We’d also include entries
        for eating-out, hopefully with a small budgeting component attached.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>A calendar for planning meals in advance to alleviate pre-planning anxieties.</b> Food in the virtual fridge will be automatically depleted
        with the click of a single button confirming that the user finished the meal (like turning in a quest in a video game, which removes items
        from player inventories).
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>The ability to upload meals publicly for others to peruse and save, which would open the potential for a recommendation algorithm based
        on what ingredients a given user currently has.</b>
      </li>
     </ol>
     We’d like to also offer a generous amount of flexibility, meaning users should be able to manually adjust any of these elements as needed to
     better accommodate and personalize their needs. Although the web app should be robust in its offerings, it hopes to extend to its users the
     freedom to be as low or high maintenance as they’d like in their interactions with the web app whilst being effective and functional regardless
     of either extreme. Ultimately, this approach hopes to optimize, organize, and make more comfortable the often stressful and wasteful processes
     of buying, storing, and consuming food in day-to-day lives.
