   <h2>Problem / Data Domain</h2>
   <p>
     Many people have encountered issues managing their groceries, resulting in food waste and preparing meals.
     According to the USDA, more than 30% of food in American households is wasted each year, mostly because
     people forget what they have in the fridge or purchase unnecessary things. This issue is especially
     targeting amongst busy students and working adults who don’t have the time to track ingredients and plan nutritious meals.
     The issue is not only an individual problem; it also has an environmental impact, since wasted food contributes to greenhouse gas
     emissions from landfills.

   <p>
     Several applications, such as Mealime and Yummly, include meal planning tools, while others, such as Fridgely, track expiration dates.
     However, most apps require users to add goods manually, which is tedious and discourages frequent use.
     A more efficient method would be to combine these features into a single web app that
     automatically counts groceries (via receipts or barcode scans), recommends meals based on available ingredients,
     and sends reminders before food expires. This would allow consumers to save money, minimize waste, and establish
     more sustainable household routines.
